# Welcome to Hulat’s site on GitHub 

The Human Language and Accessibility Technologies (HULAT) group is part of the Computer Science Department at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.

We are a multidisciplinary team of PhD holders and professionals specialized in information technologies, focusing on I+D+i projects related to Natural Language Processing (NLP), accessibility, and user interface usability.

## 🧠 Our research areas:

* Natural Language Processing (NLP):
We apply language technologies to information retrieval, question answering, text classification and extraction, and text simplification. Our research addresses various types of texts, including scientific publications, social media content, and clinical narratives.

* Accessibility:
We develop methodologies to create accessible applications and services by integrating accessibility requirements into the software development process and user interfaces. We have also contributed to national standards, such as AENOR PNE 71362:2017 for the quality of digital educational materials.

## 🤝 Collaborations
We collaborate with companies like MeaningCloud and are members of the Spanish Centre for Subtitling and Audio Description (CESyA), promoting audiovisual accessibility in diverse contexts
